Original English Version:
For his 30th birthday, Elvira chose a new computer with many accessories as a gift. She has a budget of €1500 donated by her whole family and thinks that she will be able to keep a little money to afford a garment. She goes to a computer store and chooses a machine that costs €1090 with a screen, keyboard and mouse. She also takes a scanner for €157, a CD burner worth €74 and a printer for €102. How much money will she have left for her clothing?
