Original English Version:
Steve loves playing video games. His parents get him a console along with 5 games for his birthday. He saves up enough money to buy 1 game per month for a year, and then the following year he starts buying 2 games a month. For the third year he buys 4 games a month as he has a new part-time job that makes him more money. He also gets 5 games for Christmas every year. How many games does Steve have after 3 years?
