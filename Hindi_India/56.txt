Original English Version:
Millie decides to open a lemonade stand. They spend $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade. They sell each cup of lemonade for $1. They sell an average of 4 cups per hour that their lemonade stand is open. If they sell all of the lemonade, how much profit will they make per hour that they spend running the lemonade stand?
