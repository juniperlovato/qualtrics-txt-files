Original English Version:
On Easter Sunday Cindy went to the city park to participate in the Easter Egg Hunt, and ended up with a basket full of eggs. She had 5 green ones, twice as many blue ones as green ones, one fewer pink eggs than blue eggs, and one-third as many yellow eggs as pink eggs. How many eggs did Cindy have altogether?
