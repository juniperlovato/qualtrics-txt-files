Original English Version:
Fern is trying to decide between buying the Widgeteer 3000, which makes 60 widgets an hour, and the WidgetMaster 9000, which makes 45 widgets an hour. Each widget sells for $6. How much more money will Fern make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000 if it runs 24 hours a day for a month with 30 days?
