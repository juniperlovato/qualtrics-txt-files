Original English Version:
Ron is fed up with the pothole in front of his house. If it doesn't get fixed, it's going to do $450 worth of damage to his car. Unfortunately, the city council refuses to fix it, and will fine them $120 for unauthorized road maintenance if they fix it themselves. They will also have to buy 3 buckets of asphalt that each cost $25. How much money do they save by fixing the pothole?
