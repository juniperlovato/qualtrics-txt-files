Original English Version:
David and Dasha went to the carnival, where there are 9 rides. Each ride costs 2 ride tickets at $2 per ticket. You can also buy a ride bracelet for $30 which gives you 9 rides. If David buys a ride bracelet and Dasha buys tickets, and they ride all 9 rides, how much money does David save?
