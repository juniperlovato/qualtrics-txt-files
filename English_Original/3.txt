Original English Version:
James loves to go swimming and has to swim across a 20-mile lake. They can swim at a pace of 2 miles per hour. They swim 60% of the distance. After that, they stop on an island and rests for half as long as the swimming time. They then finish the remaining distance while going half the speed. How long did it take them to get across the lake?
